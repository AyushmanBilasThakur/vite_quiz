## What is vite?

Vite uses es6 module based javascript support in browser and serves your app wihtout any webpack. It also gives HMR(Hot Module Relaod).
Rollup is used for creating the distribution folder(`dist`).

Please Note: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is not for production level app. But it is really quick for prototyping a project. As it doesn't use webpack, so it is really fast at building as well.
